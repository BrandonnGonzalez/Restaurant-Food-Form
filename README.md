# Restaurant-Food-Form


For this practice project, I embarked on creating a food order form tailored for Saucy Tango, a beloved local restaurant in our community. With an increasing demand for their delectable dishes, Saucy Tango has decided to venture into the realm of online orders, and I was entrusted with the task of bringing their vision to life.

The primary objective was to craft a user-friendly form that facilitates seamless order placement for customers. Leveraging my knowledge of React, I set out to build a functional form capable of capturing essential customer details such as name, phone number, address, and order preferences.

To accomplish this, I employed controlled React forms, utilizing the State Hook to manage the form's state dynamically. Event handlers were implemented to ensure real-time updates to the form's state as customers input their information.

Throughout the process, I adhered closely to Saucy Tango's requirements, ensuring that the form delivers a smooth and intuitive ordering experience. Upon submission, the form promptly alerts customers with their order details, providing them with a seamless online ordering journey.

In essence, this project served as a hands-on exercise in React development, allowing me to hone my skills while contributing to the growth and efficiency of a cherished local establishment.
